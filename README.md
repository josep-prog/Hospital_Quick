THIS IS MY USSD PROJECT

1. where i demonstrate usage of ussd for public service like hospital appointment booking

2. this here for making it easier for clients to book an appointment with doctor

3. this is with simplified user enterface where patient can book appointment by simply following procedural steps to book 

4. this is to help patient in general to book via video call where they can conduct doctor on matter of treatment

5. while not all people are confortable of going to the osptial as it might be time consuming we also tried to think about them by creating visual  paid call with doctor 

6. this is to help both doctor and patients by knowing easily patient who need real emergency treatment without always visual meet doctor in person 

7. however we have not left behind those who perfer inperson appoiment by using this develped app , patient will be able to visualise free booking time in which doctor is available

8. patient will also be able to know specialist available in their location who can help them with certain health condition 

9. eventhough this will not normally covered by RSSB insurance , however there will be further process which can be covered by RSSB insurance for this will require conducting hospital for getting to understand more

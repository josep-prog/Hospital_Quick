Based on your requirements, I'll create a PHP-based USSD hospital appointment booking system called "Hospital Quick" that will allow users to book appointments through a simple phone-based interface. This first version will focus on core functionality while ensuring ease of use for all age groups and technical experience levels.

Core Features:

* USSD-based appointment booking system (\*xxx\# code)  
* User account management (temporary 48-hour and permanent accounts)  
* Hospital and doctor selection by location/district  
* Appointment history viewing with password protection  
* Specialist doctor booking with video call options  
* Emergency booking for urgent cases  
* Payment integration  
* SMS notification system for confirmations

***Design Elements:***

* Simple, intuitive USSD menu structure with numbered options  
* Clear navigation paths with "back" and "home" options at each step  
* Concise text messages that fit within USSD character limits  
* Session management to maintain user state through the booking process  
* Error handling with clear, actionable feedback messages  
* Optimized menu flows to minimize the number of steps to complete tasks  
* Time-sensitive session management for security

To run the project   
node index.js

I've created a comprehensive Hospital Quick USSD-based appointment system that enables users to book medical appointments through their mobile phones using simple USSD codes. The system is designed with a focus on ease of use, making it accessible for users of all technical abilities.

The backend is built with Node.js and Express, with a MySQL database to store all appointments, user, and hospital data. The system follows a clean, modular architecture with separate services for handling sessions, notifications, payments, and appointment bookings.

To get started with the system:

1. Create a MySQL database named 'hospital\_quick'  
2. Run the schema.sql file to create all necessary tables  
3. Run the seed.sql file to populate the database with initial data  
4. Copy .env.example to .env and configure your environment variables  
5. Start the server with 'node index.js'

The system is ready to connect to a USSD gateway service that will forward user requests to your API endpoint at /api/ussd.

***USSD Project Overview***

This project demonstrates the use of USSD technology for public services, specifically for booking hospital appointments.

* It is designed to simplify the process for clients to book appointments with doctors quickly and conveniently.  
    
* The system features a user-friendly interface, allowing patients to book appointments by following simple, step-by-step procedures.  
    
* It also supports booking video call consultations, enabling patients to connect with doctors remotely for medical advice or treatment discussions.  
    
* Recognizing that not everyone is comfortable visiting hospitals due to time constraints or personal preferences, we introduced a paid visual consultation option to better serve these individuals.  
    
* This solution benefits both doctors and patients by helping to identify urgent medical cases that require immediate attention, without always needing an in-person consultation.  
    
* For those who prefer face-to-face appointments, the app allows patients to view available time slots and book in-person visits with ease.  
    
* Patients can also access information about available specialists in their area who can assist with specific medical conditions.  
    
* While video consultations may not typically be covered by RSSB insurance, there is a possibility for certain follow-up procedures to be covered. Patients will need to contact the hospital directly for further clarification on insurance eligibility.
